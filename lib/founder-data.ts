  about: {
    p1: "An innovative AI and Cybersecurity professional passionate about developing cutting-edge solutions at the intersection of quantum mechanics and conversational AI. I pioneered the Quantum Contextual Superposition (QCS) framework—a revolutionary approach that enables AI systems to anticipate user intent with 10-100× faster retrieval than traditional methods.",
    p2: "Currently serving as Gen AI Developer & Prompt Engineer at Altibbé Health, I specialize in building Agentic RAG systems and conversational AI models for healthcare applications. My work bridges theoretical research with practical implementation, creating AI systems that don't just respond—they anticipate, prepare, and collaborate."

    title: "Quantum Contextual Superposition (QCS): Redefining Conversational AI",
    problem: "Traditional AI systems are reactive. They wait for a user's input, then search a vast database to find a response. This is slow and often fails to grasp the true context of the conversation.",
    innovation: "QCS creates a continuous 'idea cloud' of potential user intents and pre-fetches relevant information. It doesn't wait; it anticipates.",
    breakthrough: "The result is a 10-100× faster context retrieval, allowing for truly fluid, real-time conversations where the AI feels like it's a step ahead.",
    components: {
      superposition: "Represents multiple potential user intents as a single superposition vector.",
      collapse: "When the user speaks, the superposition 'collapses' to the most probable context, instantly.",
      entanglement: "Links related concepts and contexts, so the AI can predict follow-up questions and related topics.",
